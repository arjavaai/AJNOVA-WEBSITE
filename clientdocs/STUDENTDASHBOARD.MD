## 12 UX & Design Principles
• Simple progress tracking: every step has a visible status bar.
• Minimal typing: most data pre-filled from profile.
• Positive tone: all system messages are friendly and encouraging.
• Consistency: same colors, icons, and tone as admin dashboard.
• Accessibility: large text, contrast-compliant colors, responsive layout.
• Clarity over decoration: plenty of white space, focused typography.

## 13 Emotional Design Notes
• Use friendly success phrases:
  ◦ "Fantastic work, [Name]! Your APS verification is complete."
  ◦ "Almost there — just one more step to unlock your SOP draft."
• Avoid harsh errors; replace with calm guidance like:
  "Please check your file format before uploading again."
• Include a subtle motivational quote near the top:
  "Progress is built one step at a time — keep going!"

## 14 Outcomes
The AjNova Student Dashboard becomes the heart of student interaction:
A single place where every applicant can understand their progress, stay organized, and feel guided instead of managed.
It mirrors the professionalism of a university portal while retaining the warmth of a mentorship app.
